# Seaborn

Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data.

Visualization is an important part of storytelling, we can gain a lot of information from data by simply just plotting the features of data. Python provides a numerous number of libraries for data visualization, we have already seen the Matplotlib library in this article we will know about Seaborn Library. 

 # What is Seaborn
 
Seaborn is an amazing visualization library for statistical graphics plotting in Python. It provides beautiful default styles and color palettes to make statistical plots more attractive. It is built on top matplotlib library and is also closely integrated with the data structures from pandas.
Seaborn aims to make visualization the central part of exploring and understanding data. It provides dataset-oriented APIs so that we can switch between different visual representations for the same variables for a better understanding of the dataset.

Different categories of plot in Seaborn 

Plots are basically used for visualizing the relationship between variables. Those variables can be either completely numerical or a category like a group, class, or division. Seaborn divides the plot into the below categories â€“ 
 

Relational plots: This plot is used to understand the relation between two variables.

Categorical plots: This plot deals with categorical variables and how they can be visualized.

Distribution plots: This plot is used for examining univariate and bivariate distributions

Regression plots: The regression plots in Seaborn are primarily intended to add a visual guide that helps to emphasize patterns in a dataset during exploratory data analyses.

Matrix plots: A matrix plot is an array of scatterplots.

Multi-plot grids: It is a useful approach to draw multiple instances of the same plot on different subsets of the dataset.
